-- Priority 1:

Learn Factorio API

Create Codebase

ADD BACK "bobores >= 0.17", "angelssmelting >= 0.5.0", but for testing purposes keeping it out

Try to use Bobs and Angels stations

Read up on bobs_library,maybe something useful for us

-- Priority 2:

Make Fission

Delete actual reactors

Make fuel crafting chain

Finish texturisation in general and especially of fuels (Notes in fission_fuels_data)

Reshape ingame uranium proccesing chain

Thorium

----------

tier 1: thorium ore + sulfuric acid + water (1:2:whatever) -> thorium
need uranium here

tier 2:
thorium ore + uranium ore + sodium hydroxide -> thorium hydroxide + sodium uranide + [trisodium phosphate], thorium hydroxide + nitric acid -> thorium + water + [nitrogen, oxygen], sodium uranide smelted -> sodium + unenriched uranium

tier 3:
unenriched uranium + HF (1:6) -> unenriched uranium hexafluoride + hydrogen (1:6) -> centrifuge to enriched uranium hexafluoride (may need a custom centrifuge as this is a gas) -> enriched uranium

don't have a tier 3 for thorium..
could make tier 2 uranium tier 1 and tier 3 uranium tier 2, but it would probably require rearranging the fuel chain, as you'd 
			start with just thorium
alternatively could have thorium and uranium processing down separate chains, and have uranium processing (which people will likely do 
		since they know what uranium is more) basically make thorium as a waste product, leading them to processing both. 
		A bit like how Angel's makes you learn to process sodium hydroxide solution when you start making hydrochloric acid, and 
		the research leads right to it
>> Players will want nukes = forcing to create the chain
we will likely do a server or some kind of playtrought event, me and Pino we will defenitely test the mod and do a run 

----------
Im no nuclear Enginier :/ (we should make this file public ? google drive ? have our version here aswell) so discord people can comment aswell
perhaps, for now keep it here so it's more convenient, one copy while it's likely to be edited significantly
